Here is what usually happens: the development team wants to push new features as fast as possible in production, while operations wants to ensure that the platform is stable and stay that way. Both teams are evaluated on criteria that are often directly conflicting; the stronger team gets to win one argument... Until the next crisis. And we're not eveng talking about other teams; they too have different objectives that will eventually go against those of one another.

There is no silver bullet to get everybody to play along nicely. That being said, getting Dev and Ops on the path to cooperation is not impossible. DevOps and best practices can be leveraged to get there: there's a better way to communicate between these two teams than yelling "The site is dooooowwwwwn!".

### What's DevOps exactly?

For the complete, uncensored version of what DevOps is, I will refer you to the almighty [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devops). In a nutshell: agile methodology applied to operations.

If this includes leveraging the same type of "tricks" as development use (SCRUMs, kanban, regular communication...), at the core lies the need for faster release cycles and a large use of best practice and modern technical approaches; IaaS, automation, configuration management (Chef, Puppets), orchestration...

### Why is it so hard then?

While agile methodologies have long been popularized among development teams, it hasn't been so among operations teams. System administrators, for example. often end up working in a fairly stretched FIFO way, running from one fire to another instead of making long term investment in automating their infrastructure. Operations teams tend to have less resources than development teams; less R&D, more cost-cutting.

Even when resources are available to these teams, it is difficult to recruit professionals with the proper experience and expertise who are able to build sustainable infrastructures. These profiles are simple rare because they require to be skilled in a wide range of skills and usually demand a fairly decent (understand long) experience on the job; best practices take time to shape.

And that's why we're building [devo.ps](http://devo.ps); helping lower the barriers to entry and helping scale DevOps professionals in their role. We're a motivated team of developers and sys-admins who have worked on small to very large online infrastructures and try to make things easier and more manageable for technical teams.
