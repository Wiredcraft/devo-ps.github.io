I'll admit the devo.ps team is a lazy bunch; we like to forget about things, especially the hard stuff. Dealing with a complex process invariably get us to vent that "we should automate that stuff". That's what our team does day and night:

1. Dumb things down, lower barriers of entry, and then...
1. **Automate all of the things!**

This has transpired through every level of our company, from engineering to operations. And there's quite a few things in the way.

### The ever increasing surface of friction

The past few years has seen a healthy push on UI and UX; good teams now engineer the relation their users have to their product, combining aesthetics and data driven design. This trend has even historically less user friendly fields like developer tools and enterprise. We now have things like Github and. Great.

This trend grew in parallel with the adoption of Software-as-a-Service platforms. A SaaS gets you the results of a team focusing on a specific problem, with the user experience often being more important than the underlying technology (not to undervalue good engineering). It is also pretty standard for these service to offer a proper API, allowing services to integrate with each other. Our CRM<sup>1</sup> plays nicely with Dropbox and GMail. Again, great.

**However, the success of SaaS means the surface of interfaces we're dealing with is constantly growing, and it's a far more difficult to overcome than poor UI or UX.** Many of us have seen teams struggling to get adoption of a great tool that happen to be one too many.

### A chat bot to rule them all...

We've tried a lot of different approaches, kicked the tires on a lot of products and end up doing the same thing we do everywhere else:

1. **Simplify**. For example, we use Github to manage most tasks and discussions, including HR and 
1. **Automate**.
1. **Make it accessible**. Now that's probably the most important point for us at this stage. Our chat bot, Borat<sup>2</sup>, is hooked up with most of our automation layer and is able to quickly answer requests or .

- Arduino plus,
- Push values over to our dashboard,
- Time tracking
- Call for SCRUMs

We invite you to do the same. Benefits...
