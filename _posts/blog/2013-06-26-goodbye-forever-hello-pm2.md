## INTRO

We love JS BUT
Putting node.js in prod > still very hard on many levels: monitoring  + logging can be ainful, traces impossible etc.
Forever > Pretty awesome, works well, but:
limited in its monitoring/loggin abilities
doesn't leverage clustered infrastructures (that's where the industry is going)
codebase is aging (breaks often)
IDEA This is why we came up with PM2 (w00t) which aims at solving these issues, and especially focused on clusteraization right off the bat
