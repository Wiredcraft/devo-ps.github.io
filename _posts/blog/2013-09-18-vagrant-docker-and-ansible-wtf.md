Given that we're building a SaaS that helps our client managing their infrastructure, our team is pretty familiar with leveraging VMs and configuration management tools. We actually have been heavy users of Vagrant and [Ansible](http://devo.ps/blog/2013/07/03/ansible-simply-kicks-ass.html) for the past year, and it's helped us tremendously normalize our development process, making sure everybody is running .

As our platform grew in complexity, some additional needs emerged:

- **Containerization**; we needed to be able to safely execute custom, and potentially harmful, code.
- **Weight**; as we added more sub-systems to devo.ps, having full blown VMs proved to be hard to juggle with when testing and developing.

And that's why we ended up adding Docker to our development workflow. We were already familiar with it (as it powers some parts of the devo.ps infrastructure) and knew there would be obvious wins. In practice, we are shipping Docker containers in a main Vagrant image and drive some of the customization and upgrade with Ansible.

We'll probably write something about this approach in the coming weeks, but given the amount of confusion there is around what these technologies are, and how they're used, we thought we'd give you a quick tour on how to use them together.

Let's get started.

## Vagrant

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

By now most of the developers have heard about Vagrant, at least on the titles of the blog posts. Vagrant was build by Mitchell Hashimoto released Jan 2010 (read more: http://www.vagrantup.com/about.html). It is a simple tool, but has made a big difference in the way we think about runtime environments.

On it's core Vagrant is just a simple wrapper around Virtualbox or VMWare offering command line interface with a few extra features. Just enough features to make using the tool easy and natural. Here are a few of our favorite features:
 - Load pre-packaged boxes form the internet
 - Snapshot your current machine to a vagrant box file you can easily share (very useful for prebuilding development machines).
 - Assign ip-interfaces to the machine
 - Setup port forwarding.
 - CLI and conf file to do this all!

Many of these are made through the Vagrantfile which includes the vagrant configuration of the machine. Downloading image, initializing, starting the machine and ssh'ing into the machine only takes three commands (http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/):
```
$ vagrant init precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```
Uncommenting and editing a few pre-written lines in `Vagantfile` gets the machine new ip interface, port forwarding in host and shared folder:
```
config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.3.88"
config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080
config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"
```

The fact that vagrant makes it so easy to manage virtual machines helps us consider our runtime environments as a set of conficuration files. We can destroy the box (just as servers can break in deployment systems) and be ready to re-initialize it into the previous state with minimal effort. Approaching development like this guarantees to keep the ops-team happy.

Docker or [docker.io](http://docker.io) is a new technology that can isolate/distribute hardware resources for softwares.
It is based on some open source technologies, including [lxc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) and [AUFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs) in linux kernel, and writing in [go](http://golang.org). Created by [dotcloud](http://www.dotcloud.com/).

What docker dose is running different software stacks on a same host machine at same time, but isolated them from each others completely.

The best part of docker is that it allow you package complete software stack into a single images, and running them an a more economic manner, compares to traditional virtual machine.
And it also ships with a nice api that make it can easily be integrated into other application.

> SIMPLE FEW LINES TO INSTALL AND GET RUNNING WITH A BASIC DOCKER IMAGE WITH NODE.JS SUPPORT RUNNING IN OUR VAGRANT IMAGE


```
# install the backported kernel
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-raring linux-headers-generic-lts-raring

# reboot
sudo reboot

# Add the Docker repository key to your local keychain
# using apt-key finger you can check the fingerprint matches 36A1 D786 9245 C895 0F96 6E92 D857 6A8B A88D 21E9
sudo sh -c "curl https://get.docker.io/gpg | apt-key add -"

# Add the Docker repository to your apt sources list.
sudo sh -c "echo deb http://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list"

# Update your sources
sudo apt-get update

# Install, you will see another warning that the package cannot be authenticated. Confirm install.
sudo apt-get install lxc-docker

# Add the docker group
sudo groupadd docker

# Add the current user, in my case, ubuntu, to the docker group
# You may have to logout and log back in again for
# this to take effect
sudo gpasswd -a ubuntu docker

# Restart the docker daemon
sudo service docker restart

# Search is there nodejs images in public registry?
docker search nodejs

# Pull down the image from docker.io public registry, this might take sometimes
docker pull howareyou/nodejs_0.10.18

# Run it, now you have a complete nodejs evnironment running inside a container
docker run -t -i howareyou/nodejs_0.10.18 /bin/bash 
```


## Ansible

- Ansible was create by [ansibleworks](www.ansibleworks.com).Ansible is a radically simple IT orchestration engine that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applicationsâ€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
- Example
  - Write an nginx yml file like this 
   ```
     ---
      - name: Ensure nginx is installed
          apt: pkg=nginx state=present
          notify: enable nginx

      - name: Backup origin nginx config
          command: mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig
                   creates=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig
                   removes=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

      - name: Add new nginx conf
          command: cp -f ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

      - name: Start nginx
   ```
     `nginx.conf` is our custom nginx configure file, proxy the node js application to 80 port.
     You can also install git with ansible, it's simple to clone git from git repository,just add 
     ```
        -name: Ensure git installed 
           apt: pkg=git stare=present
      ```
     in a task.
    
    Use `ansible-playbook yourplaybook.yml` run all playbooks and start the container with nodejs application. You can open `your custome url` in the browser
    , you will get what you want.
