We'll be hosting the Shanghai Javascript meetup tomorrow at [Wiredcraft's office](http://goo.gl/maps/lNb1Q) starting 1:30 PM. More information can be found on the [Shanghai Open Source website](http://shanghaios.org).

It will be more of an informal one to help us gather feedback from the community and plan for the March edition that will take place in a much larger venue in People Square. Don't miss it if you want to get involved. The format of the event will be the same as next month;

* 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM, Welcoming attendants
* 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, Presentation from Makara Wang, "API + Static Clients"
* 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM, Q&A
* 3:00 PM to 3:20 PM, break
* From 3:20 PM, workshops: Marionette.js, Angular.js, ...

See you there!
