It's been exactly a week since I landed in San Francisco: quite a bit happened in the mere few days I've spent here:

1. I attended Startup School and the reception prior to this at YCombinator's office.

1. I settled in my new place in the mission It's official, devo.ps is now headquartered in San Francisco.

1. We just submitted our application to YCombinator. We're trying to not get our hopes too high. That being said, no matter what the outcome is we found the exercise very interesting; I'd recommend any team working on a product to try and fill in [the application form](http://ycombinator.com/apply.html). Sequoia Capital has a set of [guidelines for business plans](http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas) that are also very useful.
