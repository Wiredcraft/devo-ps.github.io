Dev wants to push its new features, Ops want to maintain the platform up and running as much as possible. Both those teams are evaluated on criteria that are conflicting and the stronger team will often win until the next drama. And yet we've not included the other teams in the company that are also chasing their own objectives that eventually will go against each other, let it be the marketing team, the sales team, the you-name-it team.

There is no magic formula to make them all get along but, at least, having the dev and ops team fully cooperating will provide a strong incentive, being able to balance nicely between features and stability. The cooperation can be achieved through DevOps and best practices.

At least you may be able to avoid some of Angry Bob's infamous yell "The site is DOooOWN!"

### DevOps and Best practices

We are not going to redefine in detail what DevOps is; consider agile methodology applied to the release process on the operations. You can find a longer description of [DevOps on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devops).

Well thought and executed steps lead to best practices; they come from an in-depth knowledge of the technologies used, proper understanding of the applications workflow and let's not forget the countless experiences that made the success or failure of previous projects and their post-mortem analysis. Best practices are not restricted to technical work of course, it involves much more; from communication among the teams to processes and all in between...

DevOps and best practices go well along, but this is a hard subject. Profiles are hard to find, gaining advanced knowledge in all technologies takes ages. [Devo.ps](http://devo.ps) is here to help, provide automation, best practices templates and the whole shebang. Devo.ps is powered by a motivated team of hardcore developers and sys-admins that are here to share their best practices and knowledge. Future posts will soon emerge with tips and tricks about various technologies.

Don't get us wrong, we're not here to enforce a single set of best practices, but we'll do our best to provide you with well thought advises and built-in best practices. If we got it wrong, don't be shy and drop us a comment or [send us an email](mailto: bestpractice@devo.ps).
