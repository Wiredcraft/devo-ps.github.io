     <content type='html'><p>devo.ps is a complex system with a lot of moving pieces both at the code and infrastruture levels. We&#39;re deploying major releases at least once a week, and dozens of micro-releases in between for minor improvements. Having a simple yet reliable deployment workflow is essential for this to even be possible.</p></content>

     <content type='html'><p>Running programs automatically as service is not always an easy task. Some well known applications come with their own managers (e.g. unicorn, forever, pm2) but there is no unified approach across technologies.Custom build code often tend to come as a simple executable that runs in the foreground. And eventually init scripts simply ensure the services start but usually does not handle respawn.</p></content>

     <title>Deploy Your Meteor Apps on Digital Ocean in 5 Minutes</title>

     <id>http://devo.ps/blog/deploy-your-meteor-apps-on-digital-ocean-in-5-minutes</id>
     <content type='html'><p>Some of my colleagues and friends have been playing with Meteor for a few of their projects: so far they seem to love it, but when it came to hosting their app they didn&#39;t have a straight answer. They gave a quick try at the default Meteor hosting, Modulus.io and Heroku. But being the server nerd I am (and being massively in love with Digital Ocean), I thought I&#39;d look into how to self host Metero apps.</p></content>

     <title>WTF Is DevOps?</title>
     <link href='http://devo.ps/blog/wtf-is-devops'/>
     <updated>2014-09-08T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
     <id>http://devo.ps/blog/wtf-is-devops</id>
     <content type='html'><p>I recently stumbled on an article by Jeff Knupp in my (ever growing) list of &quot;to read later&quot; bookmarks: <a href="http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/04/15/how-devops-is-killing-the-developer/">How &#39;DevOps&#39; is Killing the Developer</a>. In a nutshell, he makes the point that the DevOps movement, and its reliance on cross-functional profiles (aka &quot;full stack&quot; engineers) is fair in a startup environment where resource attrition favors Jack-of-all-trades, but is a poor strategy for larger and more resourceful established businesses. I think it misses the point entirely. More importantly, it goes along the lines of a lot of criticism and misunderstanding many other voiced with regards to DevOps.</p></content>

     <content type='html'><p>We just pushed another devo.ps release (0.6.0). We are nearing a stable build and will most likely spend the next week adding more trigger for events (cron, GitHub events, devo.ps events...) and add more technologies. We have a few large updates to the documentation that should go live by next Wedneday as well.</p></content>

     <title>Metalsmith On GitHub pages</title>
     <link href='http://devo.ps/blog/metalsmith-on-github-pages'/>
     <updated>2014-09-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
     <id>http://devo.ps/blog/metalsmith-on-github-pages</id>
     <content type='html'><p>We love GitHub pages and use it more than we probably should: our <a href="http://devo.ps">main website (devo.ps)</a> and <a href="http://docs.devo.ps">documentation</a> are actually GitHub pages. We use <a href="https://swiftype.com/">SwiftType</a> to provide search on the documentation, but otherwise these are pretty regular static websites. However, we don&#39;t use Jekyll; our team is more at ease with nNde.js than Ruby, which is why we usually prefer it <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>. And since we&#39;re pretty lazy, we automate building and pushing to the <code>gh-pages</code> using <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> (of course). Here&#39;s what it looks like.</p></content>
