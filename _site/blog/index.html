    	  <p>Our team spent the past decade building, deploying and scaling online applications, sometimes to millions of users, using anything from Perl to Go. We&#39;ve worked with the largest organizations in the world, from Fortune 500 to the UN, governments as well as small, scrappy startups. And we had our fair share of servers crashing and burning. </p>

    	  <p>Given that we&#39;re building a SaaS that helps our client managing their infrastructure, our team is pretty familiar with leveraging VMs and configuration management tools. We&#39;ve actually been heavy users of Vagrant and <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/07/03/ansible-simply-kicks-ass.html">Ansible</a> for the past year, and it&#39;s helped us tremendously normalize our development process.</p>

    	  <p>While <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> is fast approaching a public release, the team has been dealing with an increasingly complex infrastructure. We more recently faced an interesting issue; how do you share configuration across a cluster of servers? More importantly, how do you do so in a resilient, secure, easily deployable and speedy fashion?</p>

    	  <p>The devo.ps team has been putting quite a few tools to the test over the years when it comes to managing infrastructures. We&#39;ve developed some ourselves and have adopted others. While the choice to use one over another is not always as clear-cut as we&#39;d like (I&#39;d love to rant about monitoring but will leave that for a later post), we&#39;ve definitely developed kind of a crush for <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a> in the past 6 months. We went through years of using Puppet, then Chef and more recently Salt Stack, before Ansible gained unanimous adoption among our team.</p>

    	  <p>It&#39;s no secret that the devo.ps team has a crush on Javascript; node.js in the backend, AngularJS for our clients, there isn&#39;t much of our stack that isn&#39;t at least in part built with it. Our approach of building <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/01/31/farewell-to-regular-web-development-approaches.html">static clients and RESTful JSON APIs</a> means that we run a lot of node.js and I must admit that, despite all of it awesomeness, node.js still is a bit of a headache when it comes to running in production. Tooling and best practices (think monitoring, logging, error traces...) are still lacking when compared to some of the more established languages.</p>

    	  <p>Something went awfully wrong, and a rogue process is eating up all of the resources on one of your servers. You have no other choice but to restart it. No big deal, really; this is the age of disposable infrastructure after all. Except when it comes back up, everything starts going awry. Half the stuff supposed to be running is down and it&#39;s screwing with the rest of your setup.</p>

    	  <p>At my <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">previous company</a>, we built Web applications for medium to large organizations, often in the humanitarian and non-profit space, facing original problems revolving around data. Things like building the <a href="http://wiredcraft.com/work/southern-sudan-referendum/index.html">voting infrastructure for the Southern Sudan Referendum</a> helped us diversify our technical chops. But until a year ago, we were still mostly building regular Web applications; the user requests a page that we build and serve back.</p>
