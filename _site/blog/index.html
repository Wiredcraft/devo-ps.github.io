    	  <p>I recently stumbled on an article by Jeff Knupp in my (ever growing) list of &quot;to read later&quot; bookmarks: <a href="http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/04/15/how-devops-is-killing-the-developer/">How &#39;DevOps&#39; is Killing the Developer</a>. In a nutshell, he makes the point that the DevOps movement, and its reliance on cross-functional profiles (aka &quot;full stack&quot; engineers) is fair in a startup environment where resource attrition favors Jack-of-all-trades, but is a poor strategy for larger and more resourceful established businesses. I think it misses the point entirely. More importantly, it goes along the lines of a lot of criticism and misunderstanding many other voiced with regards to DevOps.</p>

    	  <p>We just pushed another devo.ps release (0.6.0). We are nearing a stable build and will most likely spend the next week adding more trigger for events (cron, GitHub events, devo.ps events...) and add more technologies. We have a few large updates to the documentation that should go live by next Wedneday as well.</p>

    	  <p>We love GitHub pages and use it more than we probably should: our <a href="http://devo.ps">main website (devo.ps)</a> and <a href="http://docs.devo.ps">documentation</a> are actually GitHub pages. We use <a href="https://swiftype.com/">SwiftType</a> to provide search on the documentation, but otherwise these are pretty regular static websites. However, we don&#39;t use Jekyll; our team is more at ease with nNde.js than Ruby, which is why we usually prefer it <a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>. And since we&#39;re pretty lazy, we automate building and pushing to the <code>gh-pages</code> using <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> (of course). Here&#39;s what it looks like.</p>

    	  <p>The idea of dealing with servers is almost invariably cringe-inducing for developers. Sure, I know a few folks (me and my colleagues at <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> included) who actually get a kick out of it. But by and large, setting up infrastructure isn&#39;t the developer&#39;s favorite. There&#39;s definitely been a lot of awesome innovation in the past few years that made the whole thing manageable, especially with services like Heroku or TravisCI. But they are no silver bullets. At the end of the day, the whole experience sucks less, but it isn&#39;t near being enjoyable.</p>

    	  <p>I already said <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/the-problem-with-paas/">what I think of the NoOps/PaaS approach</a>: in my eyes, it basically means outsourcing your operations over to a team that will impose you the technologies you can work with and won&#39;t give you access to your own infrastructure. More or less a black-box. That approach obviously doesn&#39;t work well for a lot of people out there.</p>

    	  <p>The devo.ps team has been putting quite a few tools to the test over the years when it comes to managing infrastructures. We&#39;ve developed some ourselves and have adopted others. While the choice to use one over another is not always as clear-cut as we&#39;d like (I&#39;d love to rant about monitoring but will leave that for a later post), we&#39;ve definitely developed kind of a crush for <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a> in the past 6 months. We went through years of using Puppet, then Chef and more recently Salt Stack, before Ansible gained unanimous adoption among our team.</p>

    	  <p>It&#39;s no secret that the devo.ps team has a crush on Javascript; node.js in the backend, AngularJS for our clients, there isn&#39;t much of our stack that isn&#39;t at least in part built with it. Our approach of building <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/01/31/farewell-to-regular-web-development-approaches.html">static clients and RESTful JSON APIs</a> means that we run a lot of node.js and I must admit that, despite all of it awesomeness, node.js still is a bit of a headache when it comes to running in production. Tooling and best practices (think monitoring, logging, error traces...) are still lacking when compared to some of the more established languages.</p>

    	  <p>Something went awfully wrong, and a rogue process is eating up all of the resources on one of your servers. You have no other choice but to restart it. No big deal, really; this is the age of disposable infrastructure after all. Except when it comes back up, everything starts going awry. Half the stuff supposed to be running is down and it&#39;s screwing with the rest of your setup.</p>
