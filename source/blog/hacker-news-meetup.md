We'll be having our usual Hacker News meetup at **[Abbey Road](http://goo.gl/maps/Ona2p) (45 Yueyang road, near Hengshan Lu) tonight starting 7:00 PM**: come and meet entrepreneurs, technologists and likeminded individuals while sharing a couple drinks. The first round of drinks is on [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com).

Starting next week, we'll be changing a bit the format of this event:

- **Hacker News dinner, every Tuesday from 7:00 to 8:00 PM**; we're still confirming the venue. We'll be kicking off each dinner with a video of a tech or entrepreneurial talk (that you're free to ignore if you'd rather chat with other attendees).
- **Hacker News meetup, every first Tuesday of the month from 6:30 to 10:00 PM** (instead of the regular dinner); a longer event with an actual speaker on stage. We're still working out the details, but we hope to sponsor some food and drinks with the help of Wiredcraft and hopefully other local startups.

We'll be posting more information soon on the [Shanghai Hacker News meetup website](http://shanghaihn.org/). Don't hesitate to [shoot us an email](mailto:info@devo.ps) if you want to help out or sponsor.
