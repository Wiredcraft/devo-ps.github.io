INTRO: little story that provides context

PROBLEM: need to drop ou statemet

Apache: awful default settings, serious limitations w/ mem CPU etc due to thread management
NGINX: Russian, organized around multithreading

- Goes along our approach to dev (Node.js, Backbone.js...)
- Better out of the box performances
- Back it up w/ examples of CNNGo or Axel Springer


DETAIL

DETAIl

CONCLUSION

Common reason for using Apache, common fear from switching over to Nginx.
Rarely anyone want to switch over from Nginx back to Apache.

Explain the awesomeness of the rewrite rules? or the regular gotcha with Nginx.

Explain that over the last 3 years we never had to install Apache despite the numerous project we've worked on.
