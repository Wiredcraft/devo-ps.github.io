As usual, we'll be going to the monthly Hacker News meetup thrown by [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com) for all our hacker friends out there in Shanghai. If you're into technology, entrepreneurship or simply looking for an interesting discussion, join us at **[Abbey Road](http://goo.gl/maps/Ona2p) (45 Yueyang road, near Hengshan Lu) tomorrow starting 7:00 PM**. Look for the table with a maneki-neko (the lucky cat Vincent holds so graciously in the picture above).
