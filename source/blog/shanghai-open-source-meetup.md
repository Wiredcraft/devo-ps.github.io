The March edition of the [Shanghai Open Source meetup](http://shanghaios.org) will happen at a new location near People Square. There are several well equipped rooms and we're pretty excited to get started with the new format: 1 presentation of 20 to 30 minutes followed by a few workshops.

We're looking for people to speak and lead the workshops on any Open Source technology of your choice. We'll be leading a few ones ourselves with the help of the [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com) folks. Expect some [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/), [Sensu](https://github.com/sensu), [Ansible](http://ansible.cc), [node.js](http://nodejs.org), [marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com), [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and other geek galore.

Check out [the official website](http://shanghaios.org) for more information (there's an [english version](http://shanghaios.org)) and don't hesitate to [get in touch with us](mailto:info@devo.ps) if you want to present, lead a workshop or help organizing.

See you there in a couple weeks.
