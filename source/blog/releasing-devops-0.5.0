We just released a new version of devo.ps (0.5.0). A quick list of changes we made:

New Features:
- 1 click fork button; add the button in your readme and let users fork your architecture in 1 click
- Remote fork support; allows fork from public git repo
- devops.yml allowing to define global variables for the repository
- Variables overload; allows to update variables directly in the inventory without changing your files
- Array lookup in configuration; allows for more logic grouping of items in the configuration


Improvements & bug fixing:
- Fix codemirror size when no content
- Fix autocomplete for collaborators
- Fix default region / default size in node details
- Fix links in notifications
- Revamp repo activation modal
- Adding task and sync stderr and stdout for improved user experience
- Fix conflicts in dependencies
- Styling of the console
- Better file validation upon commit
- Fix error when no user / database is defined in a node configuration


Other:
- The main website and docs site have many improvements.
- Improve task execution concurrency
- Improve documentation build
