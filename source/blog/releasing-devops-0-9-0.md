- Added [Rackspace provider](http://docs.devo.ps/providers/rackspace/); new generation of cloud instances only, including regular and performance versions.
- Better variable management; fixing some issues with database passwords and arrays handling.
- Updated documentation:
    - Added sections for [PostgreSQL](http://docs.devo.ps/services/postgresql/) and [Rackspace](http://docs.devo.ps/providers/rackspace/)
    - Added [guides](http://docs.devo.ps/how-to/create-amazon-ec2-api-key/) in the *How to* section on creating cloud providers API keys
- Fixed bugs where some servers where not deleted as expected.
