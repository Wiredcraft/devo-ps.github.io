We're still working on a roadmap for the next 6 months, here are a few things that are on our radar though:

- Support for GCE, Joyent and Aliyun.
- Support for storage (S3, Glacier, etc).
- Support for migrations of databases and files.
- Snapshot of live servers.
- Export of servers as VM.
- Support for load balancing services.
- Support for multiple active branches.
- Support for service versions.
- Organizations, teams and permissions management.
